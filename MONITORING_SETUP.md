# Neural Codec HTTP System - Monitoring Setup

**Date:** 2025-10-17 13:14:46 UTC

## 🎯 Monitoring Components

### ✅ CloudWatch Dashboard
- **Name:** NeuralCodec-HTTP-Monitoring
- **URL:** https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards:name=NeuralCodec-HTTP-Monitoring
- **Metrics:** CPU, Network, Experiment counts

### ✅ CloudWatch Alarms
- `neural-codec-worker-cpu-high` - Worker CPU > 80%
- `neural-codec-orchestrator-cpu-high` - Orchestrator CPU > 80%
- `neural-codec-worker-status-check` - Worker health check failures
- `neural-codec-orchestrator-status-check` - Orchestrator health check failures

### ✅ Health Check Scripts
- `scripts/worker_health_check.sh` - Worker health monitoring
- `scripts/orchestrator_health_check.sh` - Orchestrator health monitoring

### ✅ CloudWatch Log Groups
- `/aws/neural-codec/http-worker` - Worker logs (30-day retention)
- `/aws/neural-codec/http-orchestrator` - Orchestrator logs (30-day retention)

## 🔍 Monitoring Endpoints

### Service Health Checks:
```bash
# Worker health
curl http://18.208.180.67:8080/health

# Orchestrator health  
curl http://34.239.1.29:8081/health
```

### Service Status:
```bash
# Worker status
curl http://18.208.180.67:8080/status

# Active experiments
curl http://34.239.1.29:8081/experiments
```

## 📊 Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Availability:** Service health check responses
2. **Performance:** Response times for experiments
3. **Throughput:** Experiments completed per hour
4. **Resource Usage:** CPU, memory, network utilization
5. **Error Rates:** Failed experiments, timeouts

## 🚨 Alert Thresholds

- **CPU Utilization:** > 80% for 10 minutes
- **Health Check Failures:** Any failure
- **Response Time:** > 30 seconds for experiments
- **Error Rate:** > 5% of experiments failing

## 📱 Next Steps

1. **Set up SNS notifications** for alarm alerts
2. **Configure log shipping** to CloudWatch
3. **Set up custom metrics** for experiment success rates
4. **Create automated recovery** scripts
