# ✅ Smarter Experiment Timeouts - 6 Hour Limit

**Status:** DEPLOYED & ACTIVE  
**Date:** 2025-10-17

---

## 🎯 Problem Identified

### **Analysis of Timed Out Experiments:**

```
Total Experiments: 31
Timed Out: 6 (19.4%)
Pattern: 100% stuck in validation phase
Runtime: All 10-14 minutes
Old Timeout: 10 minutes (too aggressive!)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Validation phase has **10 retries**
- Each retry can take 1-2 minutes
- Old 10-minute timeout killed experiments that were actively retrying
- **False positive timeouts** - experiments weren't stuck, just working!

---

## ⏱️ New Timeout Settings

### **Maximum Overall Timeout:**
```
Old: 1800s  (30 minutes)
New: 21600s (6 hours)
```

**Why 6 hours?**
- Validation: up to 10 retries × 5 min = 50 minutes
- Execution: up to 10 retries × 10 min = 100 minutes
- Quality verification: 30 minutes
- Buffer for LLM delays: 60 minutes
- **Total: ~4 hours typical, 6 hours max**

---

### **Per-Phase Timeouts:**

| Phase | Old Timeout | New Timeout | Change | Reason |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Design** | 5 min | 10 min | +5 min | LLM can be slow |
| **Deploy** | 1 min | 2 min | +1 min | Code saving |
| **Validation** | 10 min | **60 min** | **+50 min** | **10 retries!** |
| **Execution** | 15 min | **120 min** | **+105 min** | **10 retries + quality check!** |
| **Quality Verification** | N/A | **30 min** | New phase | Decompression + PSNR/SSIM |
| **Analysis** | 2 min | 5 min | +3 min | Blog updates |

**Key Changes:**
- Validation: 6x longer (10 min → 60 min)
- Execution: 8x longer (15 min → 120 min)
- These are the phases with retries!

## 🧠 Smart Progress Detection

### **New Logic:**

The cleanup Lambda now checks for **actual progress** before timing out:

```python
# Progress indicators:
1. has_recent_activity: elapsed_seconds updated within last 10 min
2. has_retries: validation_retries > 0 or execution_retries > 0
3. retries_not_maxed: retries < 10

# Timeout logic:
IF age > timeout AND (has_recent_activity OR has_retries):
    DON'T timeout - still working!
ELSE:
    Timeout - truly stuck
```

### **Examples:**

**Scenario 1: Validation with Retries**
```
Age: 45 minutes
Phase: validation
Validation Retries: 7
Old Behavior: ❌ Timeout (> 10 min)
New Behavior: ✅ Keep running (retries < 10)
```

**Scenario 2: Execution Making Progress**
```
Age: 90 minutes  
Phase: execution
Elapsed Seconds: 5380 (updated 20s ago)
Old Behavior: ❌ Timeout (> 15 min)
New Behavior: ✅ Keep running (recent activity)
```

**Scenario 3: Actually Stuck**
```
Age: 90 minutes
Phase: validation
Validation Retries: 0
No activity for 80 minutes
Old Behavior: ❌ Timeout
New Behavior: ❌ Timeout (correct!)
```

## 🛡️ Additional Safeguards

### **1. Minimum Age Before Timeout:**
```python
MIN_EXPERIMENT_AGE = 3600  # 1 hour
```
**Never timeout experiments younger than 1 hour**
- Gives experiments time to get started
- Prevents premature timeouts during slow starts

### **2. Activity Window:**
```python
has_recent_activity = (age - elapsed_seconds < 600)  # 10 minutes
```
**If elapsed_seconds was updated within last 10 minutes, keep running**
- Indicates orchestrator is alive and updating progress
- Prevents timeout during slow but active phases

### **3. Retry Monitoring:**
```python
has_retries = (validation_retries > 0 or execution_retries > 0)
```
**If retries are happening, keep running**
- Active retries = experiment is working through issues
- Don't timeout until max retries reached

## 📊 Expected Impact

### **Before (Old Timeouts):**
```
Timed Out: 6 experiments (19.4%)
Reason: Too aggressive timeouts
Phase: All in validation
False Positives: High (experiments were actually retrying)
```

### **After (New Timeouts):**
```
Expected Timed Out: ~0-2 experiments
Reason: Actually stuck (no progress)
Phase: Various (if stuck)
False Positives: Minimal (smart progress detection)
```

### **Validation:**
```
✅ Tested: Lambda invoked successfully
✅ Found: 3 running experiments
✅ Timed Out: 0 (all making progress)
✅ Result: Working as expected!
```

---

## 🔍 Monitoring the Changes

### **Check Cleanup Lambda Logs:**
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/ai-video-codec-experiment-cleanup \
  --follow --region us-east-1
```

**Look for:**
- `⏳ Too young to timeout` - Experiment < 1 hour
- `🔄 In [phase] with retries` - Making progress
- `✅ Running normally` - Healthy experiments
- `🔴 [exp_id]: [reason]` - Timed out (should be rare now)

### **Expected Log Output (Healthy):**
```
🧹 Starting experiment cleanup...
  Found 3 running experiment(s)
  ⏳ proc_exp_1760703456: Too young to timeout (2100s < 3600s)
  🔄 proc_exp_1760702789: In validation with retries (val=3, exec=0)
  ✅ proc_exp_1760701234: Running normally (age: 1h 45m, phase: execution)
🧹 Cleanup complete: 0 experiment(s) closed out
```

### **Timed Out Experiment (Rare):**
```
🔴 proc_exp_1760700000: Stuck in validation phase (>3600s = 60 min) with no progress
```

## 📈 Timeout Decision Tree

```
Is experiment running?
├─ No → Skip
└─ Yes
   ├─ Age < 1 hour?
   │  └─ Yes → Keep running (too young)
   └─ No
      ├─ Age > 6 hours?
      │  ├─ Has recent activity OR retries?
      │  │  └─ Yes → Keep running (still active)
      │  └─ No → TIMEOUT (exceeded max)
      └─ Age > phase timeout?
         ├─ Has retries AND retries < 10?
         │  └─ Yes → Keep running (retrying)
         ├─ Has recent activity?
         │  └─ Yes → Keep running (active)
         └─ No → TIMEOUT (stuck in phase)
```

}

# Maximum overall time
MAX_EXPERIMENT_TIME = 21600             # 6 hours

# Minimum age before considering timeout
MIN_EXPERIMENT_AGE = 3600               # 1 hour
```
