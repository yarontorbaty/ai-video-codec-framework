# Dashboard Enhancements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the enhancements made to the AiV1 dashboard, including cost tracking, worker activity logs, experiment progress tracking, and test results.

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. ✅ Custom Domain Setup
- **Domain**: `aiv1codec.com`
- **SSL Certificate**: Configured via AWS Certificate Manager
- **CloudFront Distribution**: Serves dashboard with custom domain
- **DNS**: Route 53 configured with A record alias to CloudFront

### 2. ✅ Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- **Security**: No public APIs - all data fetched and rendered server-side
- **Lambda Function**: Handles all data fetching and HTML generation
- **API Gateway**: Single `/dashboard` endpoint that invokes Lambda
- **Performance**: Faster initial page load, SEO-friendly

### 3. ✅ Real Cost Tracking with Cost Allocation Tags

#### Cost Categories
All AWS resources are now tagged with `CostCategory` for accurate cost tracking:

- **Orchestrator**: `CostCategory: Orchestrator`
  - EC2 orchestrator instance
  - Associated EBS volumes
  
- **Training**: `CostCategory: Training`
  - GPU instances (g5.4xlarge)
  - Auto-scaling training workers
  - Associated EBS volumes
  
- **Inference**: `CostCategory: Inference`
  - GPU instances (g4dn.xlarge)
  - Auto-scaling inference workers
  - Associated EBS volumes
  
- **Storage**: `CostCategory: Storage`
  - S3 buckets (artifacts, videos, models, reports)
  - EFS file system
  - EBS volumes

#### Cost Explorer Integration
The dashboard now uses AWS Cost Explorer API to fetch:
1. **Total Monthly Cost**: Real total from your AWS account
2. **Cost Breakdown by Category**: Individual costs for each `CostCategory` tag
   - Training costs
   - Inference costs
   - Storage costs
   - Orchestrator costs

**Note**: Cost allocation tags take 24 hours to activate. To activate:
1. Go to AWS Billing Console → Cost Allocation Tags
2. Find `CostCategory` tag
3. Click "Activate"

After activation, wait 24 hours for cost data to populate by category.

### 4. ✅ Worker Activity Log
Real-time tracking of worker activities:
- **Worker ID**: Identifies each worker instance
- **Activity Description**: What the worker is currently doing
  - Training neural network model
  - Processing video frames
  - Evaluating compression quality
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing completion percentage
- **Timestamps**: UTC timestamps for each activity
- **Experiment Association**: Links activities to specific experiments

**Data Source**: 
- DynamoDB table: `ai-video-codec-metrics`
- Falls back to "No data" when table is empty

### 5. ✅ Experiment Progress Tracking
Detailed experiment monitoring with completion estimates:
- **Experiment ID**: Unique identifier for each experiment
- **Status**: pending, running, completed
- **Progress Percentage**: Real-time progress calculation
- **Estimated Completion Time**: Predicted completion based on elapsed time
- **Compression Ratio**: Video compression performance
- **Quality Score**: Video quality metrics (PSNR)
- **Cost Tracking**: Estimated cost per experiment

**Progress Calculation**:
- For running experiments: Based on elapsed time vs. expected 24-hour duration
- For completed experiments: Shows 100% with "Completed" status
- For pending experiments: Shows 0% with "N/A" completion time

**Data Source**:
- DynamoDB table: `ai-video-codec-experiments`
- Falls back to "No data" when table is empty

### 6. ✅ Test Results Section
Comprehensive test metrics display:
- **Test ID**: Unique test identifier
- **Status Badge**: Color-coded (passed/failed/running)
  - Green: Passed tests
  - Red: Failed tests
  - Blue: Running tests
- **Compression Ratio**: Video compression achieved (e.g., 15.2:1)
- **Quality Score**: Overall quality rating
- **PSNR**: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (dB)
- **SSIM**: Structural Similarity Index (0-1)
- **Bitrate**: Output bitrate (Mbps)
- **Duration**: Test execution time

**Data Source**:
- DynamoDB table: `ai-video-codec-test-results`
- Falls back to "No data" when table is empty

### 7. ✅ Dashboard Sections

### 8. ✅ Bug Fixes
- Fixed "list index out of range" error when experiments list is empty
- Fixed "max() arg is an empty sequence" error with `default=0` parameter
- Fixed cost breakdown showing identical values (orchestrator and inference/storage)
- Added proper null checks for all list access operations
- Removed mock data fallbacks (now shows "No data" when tables are empty)

## Technical Implementation

### CloudFormation Templates Updated

1. **dashboard-secure-simple.yaml**
   - Lambda function for server-side rendering
   - Cost Explorer API integration with tag filters
   - DynamoDB table scanning for worker logs, experiments, and test results
   - HTML generation with embedded data

2. **compute.yaml**
   - Added `CostCategory` tags to all EC2 instances
   - Added `Project` tags for better organization
   - Tags propagate to Auto Scaling Groups

3. **storage.yaml**
   - Added `CostCategory: Storage` to all S3 buckets
   - Added `Project` tags for consistency

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows "No data"

- **Check Lambda function logs for errors**

### Cost breakdown shows $0 for categories
- **Verify cost allocation tags are activated**
- **Wait 24 hours after tag activation**
- **Check resources have correct `CostCategory` tags**

### Orchestrator CPU shows "No data"
- **Verify orchestrator instance is running**
- **Check instance ID is correct in Lambda**
- **Verify CloudWatch has EC2 metrics**
