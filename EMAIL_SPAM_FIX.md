# Fixing 2FA Email Spam Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 401 Unauthorized Error ✅
**Problem**: The `/admin/verify-2fa` endpoint required authentication, but users don't have a token yet.

**Solution**: Excluded `/admin/verify-2fa` from authentication checks (along with `/admin/login`).

### 2. Emails Landing in Spam ✅
**Problem**: SES emails from Gmail to Gmail can trigger spam filters.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added proper plain text version alongside HTML
- Improved HTML structure with proper DOCTYPE and tables
- Put code in subject line for better visibility
- Used cleaner, more professional email template
- Removed emoji from subject line

## To Prevent Future Spam Issues

### Option 1: Mark as Not Spam (Quick Fix)
1. Go to your Gmail spam folder
2. Find the "Your AiV1 verification code is XXXXXX" email
3. Select it and click "Not spam" or "Report not spam"
4. Future emails should arrive in inbox

### Option 2: Add SPF/DKIM Records (Better Solution)
If you have a custom domain, configure proper email authentication:

```bash
# Check current DKIM status
aws ses get-identity-dkim-attributes \
  --identities yarontorbaty@gmail.com \
  --region us-east-1
```

For Gmail addresses, this isn't applicable, but you can request production access:

### Option 3: Request SES Production Access (Best Solution)
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/
2. Navigate to "Account dashboard"
3. Click "Request production access"
4. Fill out the form:
   - **Use case**: Two-factor authentication for admin login
   - **Website URL**: https://aiv1codec.com
   - **Bounce/Complaint handling**: Describe your monitoring setup
   - **Daily sending quota**: Request 200 emails/day
   
Once approved, your emails will have better deliverability.

### Option 4: Use a Custom Domain Email
If you own a domain (like aiv1codec.com), set up email there:

```bash
# Verify domain instead of individual email
aws ses verify-domain-identity --domain aiv1codec.com --region us-east-1

# Add the TXT record shown in the output to your DNS
```

Then update your credentials to use `admin@aiv1codec.com` instead of Gmail.

## Current Email Template

The new email includes:
- ✅ Clean, professional HTML with proper structure
- ✅ Plain text alternative
- ✅ Code visible in subject line
- ✅ Proper spacing and formatting
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ No suspicious elements

## Testing

After the update, try logging in again:
1. Go to https://aiv1codec.com/admin.html
2. Enter credentials
3. Check both inbox AND spam folder
4. Mark as "Not spam" if needed
5. Verify the 2FA code works (no more 401 error!)

## Immediate Action

**Mark the sender as safe in Gmail:**
1. Open any email from yarontorbaty@gmail.com (even in spam)
2. Click the three dots menu
3. Select "Filter messages like this"
4. Click "Create filter"
5. Check "Never send it to Spam"
6. Click "Create filter"

This will ensure future 2FA codes arrive in your inbox.
