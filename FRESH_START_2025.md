# 🔄 Fresh Start - October 17, 2025

## ✅ System Reset Complete

All historical experiments have been **purged** to start fresh with the new meta-autonomy system.

---

## 📊 What Was Cleared:

- **130 experiments** - All from pre-meta-autonomy era
- **260 metrics** - Performance data from flawed tests  
- **62 reasoning entries** - LLM analyses based on broken data

**Total**: 452 database entries deleted

---

## 🎯 Why This Reset Was Necessary:

### Problems with Old Data:

**1. Sandbox Was Too Restrictive**
- Blocked `torchvision`, `eval()`, `bytearray`
- LLM's code failed validation before testing
- Never got real performance data

**2. No Code Evolution**
- All experiments stuck at version 0
- LLM's improvements were rejected by sandbox
- No actual codec iteration happened

**3. Misleading Insights**
- LLM was analyzing sandbox errors, not codec failures
- Repetitive reasoning about same "bugs"
- Learned from failures that weren't real

**4. No Meta-Level Autonomy**
- LLM couldn't fix framework issues
- Human intervention required for every bug
- Not truly autonomous

---

## 🚀 What's Different Now:

### 1. **Working Sandbox** ✅
- All necessary builtins allowed (bytearray, etc.)
- torchvision, torch.nn, torch.nn.functional permitted
- eval() calls for model.eval() work
- struct, base64 for binary manipulation

### 2. **Meta-Autonomy Tools** ✅
- `modify_framework_file` - Fix framework bugs
- `run_shell_command` - Run diagnostics
- `install_python_package` - Add dependencies
- `restart_orchestrator` - Apply changes
- `rollback_file` - Undo mistakes

### 3. **LLM-Powered Log Analysis** ✅
- Automatic failure diagnosis
- Root cause identification
- Fix suggestions for every error
- Displayed in dashboard

### 4. **Complete Dashboard Integration** ✅
- Code evolution tracking (v0 → v1 → v2...)
- Adoption status (✓ Adopted / ✗ Rejected)
- LLM usage costs (Claude API)
- Failure analysis with severity
- GitHub commit tracking

## 🎬 What Happens Next:

### Experiment Cycle 1 (Next 30-60 minutes):
1. **Orchestrator wakes up** → sees no experiments
2. **LLM analyzes** → "No historical data, starting fresh"
3. **Generates baseline codec** → Simple v0 implementation
4. **Tests on sample frames** → Real results this time!
5. **Stores to DynamoDB** → Experiment #1 appears on dashboard

### Experiment Cycles 2-10 (Next 6-12 hours):
1. **LLM reviews Experiment #1** → Sees real bitrate/quality data
2. **Identifies improvements** → Based on actual performance
3. **Writes better code** → Tests in sandbox successfully
4. **Adopts if better** → Version increments (v1, v2, v3...)
5. **May use tools** → If hitting framework limitations

### Expected Timeline:
- **Hour 1**: Experiment #1 (baseline) appears
- **Hour 2-3**: Experiments #2-3 (initial improvements)
- **Hour 4-6**: Experiments #4-7 (algorithm refinement)
- **Hour 6-12**: Experiments #8-15 (significant progress)
- **Day 2**: LLM may start using meta-autonomy tools
- **Day 3-7**: Codec quality should approach research-level

## 📈 What to Watch For:

### Dashboard Metrics (https://aiv1codec.com/):

**1. Code Evolution**
- ✅ Look for version numbers increasing: v0 → v1 → v2 → v3...
- ✅ Green "Adopted" badges appearing
- ✅ Non-zero "Improvement" percentages

**2. Performance Trends**
- ✅ Bitrate decreasing over time (target: 0.5-8 Mbps)
- ✅ Compression ratio improving
- ✅ Quality metrics (PSNR/SSIM) increasing

**3. LLM Reasoning** (Research Blog)
- ✅ Different insights each iteration (not repetitive)
- ✅ References previous experiments correctly
- ✅ Shows understanding of what worked/didn't work

**4. Tool Usage** (Admin Dashboard → Orchestrator logs)
- ✅ Tool calls appearing: "🛠️ LLM requested tool: ..."
- ✅ Framework modifications logged
- ✅ Self-healing behaviors

---

## 🧪 Expected Performance Evolution:

### Phase 1: Baseline (Experiments 1-5)
- **Bitrate**: 10-50 Mbps (naive implementation)
- **Version**: v0 (baseline)
- **Goal**: Establish working pipeline

### Phase 2: Basic Optimization (Experiments 6-15)
- **Bitrate**: 5-15 Mbps (simple compression)
- **Version**: v1-v3 (incremental improvements)
- **Goal**: Reduce data through quantization, color palettes

### Phase 3: Algorithmic Refinement (Experiments 16-30)
- **Bitrate**: 2-8 Mbps (motion compensation, DCT)
- **Version**: v4-v7 (significant changes)
- **Goal**: Proper codec techniques (keyframes, deltas, etc.)

### Phase 4: Neural Compression (Experiments 31-50)
- **Bitrate**: 0.5-3 Mbps (learned compression)
- **Version**: v8-v12 (neural approaches)
- **Goal**: State-of-the-art neural video codec

### Phase 5: Self-Improvement (Experiments 51+)
- **Bitrate**: <0.5 Mbps (research-level)
- **Version**: v13+ (LLM discovering novel techniques)
- **Goal**: Publications, patents, emergent behaviors
