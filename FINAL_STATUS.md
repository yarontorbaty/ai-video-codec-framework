## ‚úÖ MAJOR ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

### Problem: Old v1 Workers Consuming SQS Messages

**Root Cause Found:**
- 3 old v1 workers (`training_worker.py`) were running on other instances:
  - `i-0a82b3a238d625628` (training-worker)
  - `i-0765ebfc7ace91c37` (training-worker)
  - `i-060787aed0e674d88` (experiment-final)

**Impact:**
- These old workers were polling the SAME SQS queue as the new v2 worker
- Messages were being consumed by v1 workers (which don't understand v2 format)
- This explained why messages showed as "in-flight" but v2 worker saw "No jobs available"

**Resolution:**
- Stopped all old v1 workers with `pkill -f training_worker.py`
- Queue is now exclusively available to v2 worker

## üìä Current System State

### Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ All instances running
- ‚úÖ IAM permissions correct (SQSFullAccess confirmed)
- ‚úÖ Network connectivity verified

### v2.0 Deployment
- ‚úÖ GPU Worker code deployed (`neural_codec_gpu_worker.py`)
- ‚úÖ Orchestrator code deployed (`gpu_first_orchestrator.py`)
- ‚úÖ Encoding/Decoding agents deployed
- ‚úÖ Dashboard API updated for v2 compatibility

### SQS Queue
- ‚úÖ Purged and cleaned
- ‚úÖ Old v1 workers stopped
- ‚úÖ Now exclusively for v2 worker

### GPU Worker (i-0b614aa221757060e)
- ‚úÖ Running (Process ID varies after restarts)
- ‚úÖ Polling every 20 seconds
- ‚úÖ Using correct queue URL
- ‚úÖ Has proper IAM permissions

---

## üîç Testing Performed

1. **IAM Permissions Check** - Confirmed worker has full SQS access
2. **Code Verification** - Confirmed v2 worker code is deployed
3. **Queue Cleanup** - Purged queue multiple times
4. **Manual SQS Test** - Verified worker can technically access queue
5. **Instance Discovery** - Found 3 old v1 workers consuming messages
6. **Worker Shutdown** - Stopped all conflicting v1 workers

---

## üéØ Next Steps to Complete Testing

### 1. Restart v2 Worker (Clean State)
```bash
aws ssm send-command \
  --instance-ids i-0b614aa221757060e \
  --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \
  --parameters 'commands=[
    "pkill -f neural_codec_gpu_worker",
    "cd /home/ubuntu/ai-video-codec-framework",
    "nohup python3 workers/neural_codec_gpu_worker.py > /tmp/gpu_worker.log 2>&1 &",
    "sleep 2",
    "tail -10 /tmp/gpu_worker.log"
  ]'
```

### 2. Send Test Message
```python
import boto3, json, time
sqs = boto3.client('sqs', region_name='us-east-1')
job = {
    'experiment_id': 'test_v2_clean',
    'timestamp': int(time.time()),
    'type': 'test'
}
sqs.send_message(
    QueueUrl='https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/580473065386/ai-video-codec-training-queue',
    MessageBody=json.dumps(job)
)
```

### 3. Monitor v2 Worker
```bash
# Wait 25 seconds for worker to poll
# Then check logs
aws ssm send-command \
  --instance-ids i-0b614aa221757060e \
  --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \
  --parameters 'commands=["tail -50 /tmp/gpu_worker.log"]'
```

## üìà Progress Summary

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Infrastructure Setup | ‚úÖ 100% | All instances running |
| v2 Code Deployment | ‚úÖ 100% | All files in place |
| IAM Permissions | ‚úÖ 100% | Confirmed correct |
| Old Workers Stopped | ‚úÖ 100% | 3 v1 workers killed |
| Queue Cleaned | ‚úÖ 100% | Purged successfully |
| v2 Worker Test | ‚è≥ Pending | Needs fresh restart |
| End-to-End Pipeline | ‚è≥ Pending | Next test |

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **Multiple Consumers**: Always check for old/duplicate workers on other instances
2. **SQS "In-Flight"**: Doesn't mean YOUR worker received it - could be another consumer
3. **Long Visibility Timeout**: 1-hour timeout meant test messages stayed hidden
4. **Purge Delay**: SQS purge takes 60 seconds to complete

---

## üöÄ Recommendation

**Run one more clean test** now that old v1 workers are stopped:
1. Restart v2 worker with fresh logs
2. Send single test message
3. Verify worker picks it up
4. Confirm end-to-end pipeline works

The infrastructure is solid - we just had competing consumers.
