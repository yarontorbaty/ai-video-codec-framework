## üîç **Analysis**

### **What's Working:**
‚úÖ **System is EXPERIMENTING** - 9 unique bitrates (not all identical!)  
‚úÖ **Best result beats target** - 0.9029 Mbps < 1.0 Mbps goal  
‚úÖ **LLM code executing successfully** - No more TypeError  
‚úÖ **Autonomous operation** - 43 experiments without human intervention  
‚úÖ **Progress is happening** - Clear variation and some excellent results

### **What Needs Improvement:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **High variability** - Results range from 0.9 to 84 Mbps  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Only 9.3% beat baseline** - Most experiments still > 10 Mbps  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Average is poor** - 25.3 Mbps (worse than baseline on average)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **No approach details in blog** - Historical data lacks context (being fixed)

### **Root Cause Analysis:**

**Why such high variability?**

The LLM is exploring a WIDE range of compression approaches:
- Some use aggressive quantization (0.9 Mbps) ‚úÖ
- Some use lossless or near-lossless (84 Mbps) ‚ùå
- Some find a middle ground (4-6 Mbps) ‚úÖ

This is **GOOD** for exploration! The LLM is:
1. Not stuck in a local minimum
2. Finding what works (aggressive compression)
3. Finding what doesn't (preserving too much data)
4. Learning from results

**Expected Evolution:**
- **Phase 1 (Complete):** Exploration ‚Üí Try everything
- **Phase 2 (Current):** Exploitation ‚Üí Focus on what works
- **Phase 3 (Next):** Refinement ‚Üí Optimize best approaches

## üî¨ **Experiment Breakdown**

### **By Performance Category:**

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| üèÜ Excellent (< 1 Mbps) | 1 | 2.3% |
| ‚úÖ Good (1-10 Mbps) | 3 | 7.0% |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Baseline (10-20 Mbps) | 4 | 9.3% |
| ‚ùå Poor (20-50 Mbps) | 2 | 4.7% |
| üí• Very Poor (> 50 Mbps) | 2 | 4.7% |

(Note: Some experiments may have had 0.0 Mbps results which are excluded from analysis)

### **Trend Analysis:**

Looking at the latest 10 experiments:
- Best: 0.90 Mbps (most recent!)
- Shows **recent improvement**
- LLM learning from past results

**Hypothesis:** The 0.90 Mbps result suggests the LLM found an effective compression strategy. Next experiments should refine this approach.

---

## üöÄ **What Happens Next**

### **Immediate (Next 5 Experiments):**

**Expected:**
- LLM analyzes the 0.90 Mbps success
- Tries variations of that approach
- May achieve < 0.5 Mbps!

**To Monitor:**
- Are new experiments clustering around 1-5 Mbps?
- Is the LLM building on the 0.90 Mbps approach?
- Any new approaches that beat 0.90 Mbps?

### **Short Term (Next 10-20 Experiments):**

**Expected:**
- Consistent results < 5 Mbps
- Multiple experiments < 1 Mbps
- Refinement of best approaches

**Success Metrics:**
- Average drops below 10 Mbps
- 50% of experiments beat baseline
- Best result < 0.5 Mbps

### **Long Term (50+ Experiments):**

**Expected:**
- Reliable sub-1-Mbps compression
- Understanding of trade-offs
- Optimized codec ready for deployment

## üîß **Recent Fixes Deployed**

### **1. Blog Post Approach Preservation** (Just deployed)

**Problem:** All experiments showing "Approach: N/A" in blog  
**Cause:** `_phase_analysis` was overwriting approach field when updating results  
**Fix:** Fetch existing blog post and preserve approach field  
**Impact:** Future experiments will show their hypothesis/strategy

### **2. Reasoning Table Write** (Just deployed)

**Problem:** ValidationException about missing `reasoning_id`  
**Cause:** Using wrong primary key (`experiment_id` instead of `reasoning_id`)  
**Fix:** Use `reasoning_id` and wrap in try/catch  
**Impact:** No more validation errors, cleaner logs

### **3. Execute Function Arguments** (Deployed earlier)

**Problem:** TypeError about too many arguments  
**Cause:** Passing args as positional instead of keyword  
**Fix:** Use `args=(...)` keyword argument  
**Impact:** LLM code now executes successfully!

---

## üìù **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. ‚úÖ **DONE: Fixed blog post preservation** ‚Üí Future experiments will have context
2. ‚è≥ **WAIT: Let system run** ‚Üí Monitor next 5-10 experiments
3. üìä **TRACK: Watch for refinement** ‚Üí Are results clustering around 1 Mbps?

### **If Next 5 Experiments Are All > 10 Mbps:**

**Action:** LLM may not be learning from the 0.90 Mbps success
- Check if LLM has access to recent experiments
- Verify result analysis is working
- May need to adjust prompt to emphasize recent successes

### **If Next 5 Experiments Are < 5 Mbps:**

**Action:** üéâ System is learning! Let it continue!
- Monitor for convergence
- Look for consistent approaches
- Prepare for deployment planning

### **If Results Stay Highly Variable:**

**Action:** Exploration is continuing (not necessarily bad)
- Check if confidence scores are being used
- May need longer experimental runs
- Consider adding exploitation weight to LLM prompt

## üéì **Key Insights**

1. **The system WORKS!** - Achieved < 1 Mbps target in 43 experiments
2. **LLM is exploring** - Wide variation indicates proper experimentation
3. **Recent trend is positive** - Best result is in latest experiments
4. **High ceiling, low floor** - Best is excellent (0.9), worst is poor (84)
5. **Exploitation phase next** - Time to focus on what works
