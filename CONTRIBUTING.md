## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code (protected)
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local repository
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ...

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Run linters
black .
flake8 .
mypy .

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## üé® Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some modifications:

- **Line length:** 100 characters (not 79)
- **Formatter:** Black (automatically enforced)
- **Linter:** Flake8
- **Type hints:** Use mypy for type checking

```python
# Good example
def train_model(
    model: nn.Module,
    data_loader: DataLoader,
    optimizer: torch.optim.Optimizer,
    epochs: int = 10,
) -> dict[str, float]:
    """
    Train a neural network model.
    
    Args:
        model: PyTorch model to train
        data_loader: DataLoader with training data
        optimizer: Optimizer for training
        epochs: Number of training epochs
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with training metrics
    """
    metrics = {}
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        loss = train_epoch(model, data_loader, optimizer)
        metrics[f"epoch_{epoch}"] = loss
        
    return metrics
```

### Documentation Style

- **Docstrings:** Google style
- **Comments:** Clear and concise, explain *why* not *what*
- **README updates:** Update relevant docs when adding features

```python
def compute_psnr(original: torch.Tensor, reconstructed: torch.Tensor) -> float:
    """
    Compute Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio between two images.
    
    Args:
        original: Original image tensor (B, C, H, W)
        reconstructed: Reconstructed image tensor (B, C, H, W)
        
    Returns:
        PSNR value in decibels (dB)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If tensor shapes don't match
        
    Example:
        >>> original = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)
        >>> reconstructed = original + 0.1 * torch.randn_like(original)
        >>> psnr = compute_psnr(original, reconstructed)
        >>> print(f"PSNR: {psnr:.2f} dB")
    """
    # Implementation
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

```python

from codec.models import SimpleAutoencoder

def test_autoencoder_forward():
    """Test autoencoder forward pass."""
    model = SimpleAutoencoder(channels=64)
    x = torch.randn(2, 3, 8, 64, 64)  # Batch of video clips
    
    output = model(x)
    
    assert output.shape == x.shape
    assert not torch.isnan(output).any()
    

def test_autoencoder_compression():
    """Test that autoencoder compresses representation."""
    model = SimpleAutoencoder(channels=64)
    x = torch.randn(1, 3, 8, 64, 64)
    
    latent = model.encode(x)
    reconstructed = model.decode(latent)
    
    # Latent should be smaller than input
    assert latent.numel() < x.numel()
    # Reconstruction should match input shape
    assert reconstructed.shape == x.shape
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_codec.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run only fast tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```
