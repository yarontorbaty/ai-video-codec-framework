## 📡 Technical Implementation

### **Frontend** (`dashboard/blog.html`)
- Standalone HTML page
- Fetches data from API Gateway
- JavaScript rendering
- No external dependencies (except styles)

### **Backend** (`lambda/index.py`)
- New `get_reasoning()` function
- Queries `ai-video-codec-reasoning` DynamoDB table
- Returns formatted LLM analysis
- Handles JSON parsing of nested fields

### **API Endpoint**
```

The blog combines data from multiple DynamoDB tables:

1. **`ai-video-codec-experiments`** - Experiment results
   - Bitrate achieved
   - Compression ratio
   - Status (completed/failed)
   - Timestamp

2. **`ai-video-codec-reasoning`** - LLM analysis
   - Root cause analysis
   - Hypotheses
   - Next experiment plans
   - Confidence scores
   - Insights and risks

## 📈 Example Blog Post

**Iteration 3: Store Procedural Parameters Instead of Rendered Frames**

**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Experiment ID:** real_exp_1760581234

### 🎯 What We Tried
Store procedural generation parameters (~100 bytes per frame) instead of rendering full video frames (~600KB per frame). This approach treats video compression as a code generation problem.

### 📊 Results
- **Bitrate:** 15.04 Mbps
- **vs HEVC:** +50.4% (worse)
- **Confidence:** 75%

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
Procedural generation is rendering full video frames (18MB) instead of storing compact procedural parameters (<1KB). The system generates NEW content rather than compressing EXISTING content.

### 💡 Key Insights
- All experiments show 15 Mbps output (50% LARGER than 10 Mbps HEVC baseline)
- Neural networks are operational but not integrated into compression pipeline
- The fundamental approach is backwards - we're creating data, not compressing it

### 🚀 Next Steps
**Approach:** Encode video as a sequence of procedural commands

**Changes:**
- Analyze input video to detect procedural patterns
- Store only generation parameters in compact format
- Implement decoder that regenerates frames from parameters
- Measure parameter storage size vs rendered video size

**Expected Bitrate:** 0.8 Mbps  
**Confidence:** 75%

### ⚠️ Known Risks
- Input video may not be procedurally representable
- Quality loss if procedural approximation is poor
- Decoder complexity may be too high for real-time
