# ‚úÖ Quality Verification Loop CLOSED!

**Status:** DEPLOYED & RUNNING  
**Date:** 2025-10-17

---

## üéØ What Was Done

### 1. **Data Cleanup** ‚úÖ
- **Purged:** 39 experiments (>= 5 Mbps or invalid)
- **Kept:** 11 experiments (all < 5 Mbps):
  - 0.0052 Mbps (proc_exp_1760689002)
  - 0.0281 Mbps (proc_exp_1760695276)
  - 0.1677 Mbps (proc_exp_1760696502)
  - 0.2828 Mbps (proc_exp_1760689170)
  - 0.9029 Mbps (proc_exp_1760700290)
  - 2.6614 Mbps (proc_exp_1760691287)
  - 3.0104 Mbps (proc_exp_1760695453)
  - 3.3383 Mbps (proc_exp_1760692844)
  - 3.8049 Mbps (proc_exp_1760694912)
  - 4.5328 Mbps (proc_exp_1760698872)
  - 4.7190 Mbps (proc_exp_1760699295)

---

### 2. **LLM Prompt Updated** ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/agents/llm_experiment_planner.py`

**Changes:**
- Now REQUIRES both `compress_video_frame()` AND `decompress_video_frame()`
- Added quality targets: PSNR >= 30 dB (acceptable), >= 35 dB (good)
- Added `expected_psnr_db` to LLM output
- Emphasizes quality vs bitrate tradeoff
- Clear quality scale provided to LLM

**Quality Thresholds Provided to LLM:**
```
- PSNR < 25 dB: Poor quality (blocky/blurry)
- PSNR 25-30 dB: Acceptable quality
- PSNR 30-35 dB: Good quality (TARGET!)
- PSNR > 35 dB: Excellent quality (H.264/HEVC level)
```

**Optimization Goal:**
```
Minimize: bitrate
Subject to: bitrate < 5 Mbps AND PSNR >= 30 dB
```

---

### 3. **Quality Verification Implemented** ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/agents/adaptive_codec_agent.py`

**New Process:**
1. ‚úÖ Compress all frames with LLM code
2. ‚úÖ **Decompress all frames** (NEW!)
3. ‚úÖ **Calculate PSNR** for each frame (NEW!)
4. ‚úÖ **Calculate SSIM** for each frame (NEW!)
5. ‚úÖ **Save reconstructed video** for visual verification (NEW!)
6. ‚úÖ **Categorize quality**: excellent/good/acceptable/poor (NEW!)

**New Metrics Tracked:**
- `psnr_db`: Average PSNR across all frames
- `ssim`: Average SSIM across all frames
- `quality`: Text label (excellent/good/acceptable/poor)
- `quality_verified`: Boolean flag

**Reconstructed Videos Saved:**
- Location: `/tmp/reconstructed_{timestamp}.mp4` on orchestrator
- Can be downloaded for visual comparison with original

---

### 4. **Validation Enhanced** ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/agents/adaptive_codec_agent.py`

**New Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Verifies `compress_video_frame` function exists
- ‚úÖ Warns if `decompress_video_frame` missing
- ‚úÖ Logs clear warnings about quality verification impact

---

## üìä What's Now Measured

### Before (Old System):
```python
{
    'bitrate_mbps': 0.0052,
    'file_size_mb': 0.0065
}
```

### After (New System):
```python
{
    'bitrate_mbps': 0.0052,
    'file_size_mb': 0.0065,
    'psnr_db': 32.5,              # NEW!
    'ssim': 0.92,                 # NEW!
    'quality': 'good',            # NEW!
    'quality_verified': True      # NEW!
}
```

## üöÄ What Happens Next

### **Orchestrator Status:** ‚úÖ RUNNING

**Current Status:**
- Orchestrator is running with new quality verification code
- Processing new experiment with updated prompt
- Will generate BOTH compress + decompress functions
- Will measure PSNR/SSIM for all new experiments

### **Expected Results:**

**For new experiments:**
1. LLM generates compress + decompress functions
2. System compresses frames
3. System decompresses frames
4. PSNR/SSIM measured
5. Quality verified and saved

**Success Criteria:**
- Bitrate < 5 Mbps ‚úÖ
- PSNR >= 30 dB (good quality) ‚úÖ
- Reconstructed video saved ‚úÖ

## üéØ The 11 Kept Experiments

These will be re-tested with quality verification in future runs:

| Rank | Experiment ID | Bitrate | Status |
|------|---------------|---------|--------|
| ü•á 1 | proc_exp_1760689002 | 0.0052 Mbps | Kept |
| ü•à 2 | proc_exp_1760695276 | 0.0281 Mbps | Kept |
| ü•â 3 | proc_exp_1760696502 | 0.1677 Mbps | Kept |
| 4 | proc_exp_1760689170 | 0.2828 Mbps | Kept |
| 5 | proc_exp_1760700290 | 0.9029 Mbps | Kept |
| 6 | proc_exp_1760691287 | 2.6614 Mbps | Kept |
| 7 | proc_exp_1760695453 | 3.0104 Mbps | Kept |
| 8 | proc_exp_1760692844 | 3.3383 Mbps | Kept |
| 9 | proc_exp_1760694912 | 3.8049 Mbps | Kept |
| 10 | proc_exp_1760698872 | 4.5328 Mbps | Kept |
| 11 | proc_exp_1760699295 | 4.7190 Mbps | Kept |

**Note:** These experiments have bitrate measurements but NO quality verification yet. The LLM didn't generate decompress functions for them.

**Future:** When the LLM learns the new approach (compress + decompress), it may achieve similar low bitrates WITH verified quality!

---

## üìà Expected Timeline

### **Hour 1-2 (Immediate):**
- First experiment with quality verification completes
- Results show bitrate + PSNR + SSIM
- Validate that decompress function works

### **Hour 3-6:**
- 3-5 experiments with quality verification
- See if quality-verified results can match low bitrates
- Identify if 0.0052 Mbps is achievable with PSNR >= 30 dB

### **Day 1:**
- 10-15 experiments with full quality metrics
- Identify best approach: low bitrate + good quality
- May discover optimal tradeoff point

### **Week 1:**
- Consistent results with quality verification
- Production-ready codec with measured quality
- Ready for comparison with HEVC/AV1

## üîç How to Monitor

### **Check Orchestrator Logs:**
```bash
# Via SSM
INSTANCE_ID=i-063947ae46af6dbf8
aws ssm send-command --instance-ids "$INSTANCE_ID" \
  --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \
  --parameters 'commands=["tail -50 /tmp/orch.log"]' \
  --region us-east-1
```

### **Look for Quality Metrics:**
```bash
# Search for PSNR/SSIM in logs
grep -E "(PSNR|SSIM|Quality metrics)" /tmp/orch.log
```

### **Check for Decompress Function:**
```bash
# Verify LLM is generating decompress function
grep "decompress_video_frame" /tmp/code_attempts/*.py | wc -l
```

### **Download Reconstructed Video:**
```bash
# Find reconstructed videos
ls -lh /tmp/reconstructed_*.mp4

# Download for visual comparison
scp orchestrator:/tmp/reconstructed_*.mp4 ./
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Mitigations

### **Issue 1: LLM May Not Generate Decompress at First**

**Symptom:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Missing decompress_video_frame function!
   Quality verification will fail - PSNR/SSIM cannot be measured
```

**Mitigation:**
- System logs warning but continues
- LLM will see failed quality verification in results
- Next iteration should adapt and include decompress

**Action:** Monitor first 2-3 experiments to see if LLM learns

---

### **Issue 2: Decompression May Fail**

**Symptom:**
```
Frame 42 decompression failed: ...
```

**Cause:** LLM-generated decompress logic has bugs

**Mitigation:**
- System logs error and uses black frame
- PSNR will be low ‚Üí LLM will see failure
- Self-healing should fix in next iteration

**Action:** Check failure_analysis in results

---

### **Issue 3: Quality May Be Low Initially**

**Expected:** First experiments with quality verification might show:
- Bitrate: 0.5 Mbps (good!)
- PSNR: 15 dB (poor!)

**This is OK!** The LLM will:
1. See low PSNR in results
2. Understand quality is poor
3. Adjust approach to improve quality
4. Find optimal bitrate/quality tradeoff

---

## üéâ Success Metrics
