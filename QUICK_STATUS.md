# Quick Status - v2.0 Deployment

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **GPU Worker**: Running on AWS (Process ID 5989), polling every 20 seconds
2. **Infrastructure**: All deployed (orchestrator, GPU worker, SQS, DynamoDB, S3)
3. **Dashboard**: Updated to support v2.0 experiments
4. **Code**: All v2.0 files in place locally and on AWS
5. **LLM Parser**: Fixed to handle both v1 and v2 response formats

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

The experiment script hangs when calling the Claude API. The LLM responds, but:
- It's using the OLD v1 system prompt (returns `generated_code` instead of separate encoding/decoding agents)
- The response has malformed JSON (unterminated strings in the large code block)
- The manual extractor now handles this, but the experiment is slow

## üéØ What We Need

**Option 1: Quick Test (Simpler)**
Just test if the GPU worker can pick up a job:
```bash
# Manually send a test job to SQS
aws sqs send-message \
  --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/580473065386/ai-video-codec-training-queue \
  --message-body '{"test": "hello from v2"}'
  
# Check GPU worker logs
aws ssm send-command --instance-ids i-0b614aa221757060e \
  --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \
  --parameters 'commands=["tail -20 /tmp/gpu_worker.log"]'
```

**Option 2: Fix System Prompt (Better)**
The v2 system prompt should guide Claude to generate TWO separate agent codes, but it's still returning v1 format. We could:
1. Update the system prompt to be more explicit
2. Or accept v1 format and have the orchestrator split the code

**Option 3: Run Simple Experiment (Fastest)**
Skip the LLM entirely for now and dispatch a hardcoded experiment to test the full pipeline:
```python
# Test without LLM
from src.agents.gpu_first_orchestrator import GPUFirstOrchestrator
orch = GPUFirstOrchestrator()
# Manually create experiment job and dispatch to SQS
```

## üìä Progress

- Infrastructure: 100% ‚úÖ
- Code Deployment: 100% ‚úÖ
- LLM Integration: 95% ‚ö†Ô∏è (works but slow, format compatibility)
- End-to-End Test: 0% ‚è≥ (not completed yet)

## üí° Recommendation

**Run a simple end-to-end test** without waiting for LLM:
1. Create a minimal experiment payload
2. Send directly to SQS
3. Watch GPU worker pick it up
4. Verify results appear in DynamoDB
5. Check dashboard displays it

This confirms the v2.0 pipeline works, then we can optimize the LLM integration separately.
