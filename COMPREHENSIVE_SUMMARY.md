# Comprehensive Summary - v2.0 Deployment Attempt

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Duration:** ~3 hours of debugging  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED

---

## üéØ What We Were Trying to Do

Deploy v2.0 Neural Codec system with:
- Two-agent architecture (encoding + decoding)
- GPU-first approach
- Scene-adaptive compression
- SQS-based job distribution
- Goal: 90% bitrate reduction, >95% quality

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Successfully Completed

### 1. Code Development & Deployment
- ‚úÖ Created `encoding_agent.py` and `decoding_agent.py`
- ‚úÖ Created `gpu_first_orchestrator.py`
- ‚úÖ Created `neural_codec_gpu_worker.py`
- ‚úÖ Updated `llm_experiment_planner.py` with v1/v2 format compatibility
- ‚úÖ Updated `framework_modifier.py` with path auto-detection
- ‚úÖ Updated `dashboard_api.py` for v2 compatibility
- ‚úÖ Deployed all files to AWS instances via S3

### 2. Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ GPU worker instance running (i-0b614aa221757060e)
- ‚úÖ Orchestrator instance deployed (i-063947ae46af6dbf8)
- ‚úÖ IAM permissions verified (SQSFullAccess confirmed)
- ‚úÖ Network connectivity confirmed
- ‚úÖ System prompt updated to v2 format

### 3. Debugging & Discovery
- ‚úÖ Identified 3 old v1 workers consuming messages
- ‚úÖ Found systemd service auto-restarting workers
- ‚úÖ Disabled `ai-video-codec-worker.service` on all instances
- ‚úÖ Purged SQS queue multiple times
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation

## ‚ùå What's NOT Working

### The Core Problem: v2 Worker Cannot Receive SQS Messages

**Symptoms:**
- Messages sent to SQS successfully
- Messages show as "in-flight" (received by something)
- v2 worker logs: "No jobs available" 
- Worker polls every 20 seconds correctly
- IAM permissions are correct

**What We've Ruled Out:**
1. ‚ùå IAM Permissions - Confirmed correct (SQSFullAccess)
2. ‚ùå Network Issues - Worker can connect to SQS
3. ‚ùå Old v1 Workers - All stopped and service disabled
4. ‚ùå Queue Configuration - Purged and clean
5. ‚ùå Code Deployment - v2 files confirmed on instance

**What We Haven't Fully Investigated:**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è v2 worker code bug in SQS polling logic
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Message format incompatibility  
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Another hidden consumer we haven't found
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è SQS queue permissions/policy
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Worker's boto3 client configuration

## üîç Key Discoveries

### Discovery 1: Multiple Competing Consumers
- Found 3 v1 workers on separate instances
- All polling the SAME SQS queue
- Located at:  
  - i-0a82b3a238d625628
  - i-0765ebfc7ace91c37
  - i-060787aed0e674d88

### Discovery 2: SystemD Auto-Restart
- Service: `ai-video-codec-worker.service`
- Auto-restarted workers every time we killed them
- Took 3 attempts to discover this
- Now disabled on all instances

### Discovery 3: LLM Format Compatibility
- LLM returning v1 format (`generated_code`)
- v2 expects separate `encoding_agent_code` + `decoding_agent_code`
- Added compatibility layer to handle both

## üìä Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 15:00 | Started v2.0 deployment |
| 17:30 | Deployed code to AWS via SSM |
| 18:00 | Started testing SQS pipeline |
| 18:02 | Found 3 old v1 workers |
| 18:36 | Killed v1 workers (first time) |
| 18:42 | Workers restarted automatically |
| 18:52 | Discovered systemd service |
| 18:53 | Disabled service, killed workers again |
| 18:56 | Still unable to receive messages |

---

## ü§î Possible Remaining Issues

### Theory 1: v2 Worker Code Bug
The `poll_queue()` method in `neural_codec_gpu_worker.py` might have a bug:
- Wrong queue URL
- Incorrect polling parameters
- Exception being silently swallowed
- Region mismatch

### Theory 2: Message Format
The test messages we're sending might not match what the worker expects:
```python
# What we're sending:
{'experiment_id': 'test', 'type': 'test'}

# What worker might expect:
{'experiment_id': 'test', 'encoding_code': '...', 'decoding_code': '...'}
```

### Theory 3: Another Hidden Service
There might be:
- Another systemd service we missed
- A Lambda function consuming from the queue
- An auto-scaling group with more workers
- A different queue with similar name

### Theory 4: SQS Queue Policy
The queue might have a resource policy that restricts who can receive:
- Only specific IAM roles
- Only specific IP ranges
- Visibility timeout issues

---

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Debug v2 Worker Code (Technical)
1. Add extensive logging to worker's `poll_queue()` method
2. Test SQS receive manually from worker instance
3. Compare with old v1 worker code that DID work
4. Check for exceptions being caught silently

### Option B: Fresh Start (Clean Slate)
1. Stop ALL instances temporarily
2. Verify queue is completely empty
3. Start only v2 worker
4. Send one simple message
5. Watch for pickup

### Option C: Use Different Queue (Workaround)
1. Create a brand new SQS queue
2. Update v2 worker to use new queue
3. Test if messages flow correctly
4. This would confirm if it's a queue-specific issue

### Option D: Accept Current State (Pragmatic)
1. System is 95% deployed
2. Only SQS messaging is blocked
3. Could test orchestrator‚Üíworker flow locally
4. Could investigate async at a later time

## üí° Bottom Line

**Infrastructure:** 100% Ready ‚úÖ  
**Code:** 100% Deployed ‚úÖ  
**Old Workers:** 100% Disabled ‚úÖ  
**SQS Messaging:** 0% Working ‚ùå

The v2.0 system is built and deployed, but the SQS communication between orchestrator‚Üíworker is blocked. This is likely either:
1. A bug in the v2 worker's SQS polling code, OR
2. A hidden consumer/service we haven't found yet

**Estimated time to resolve:** 30-60 minutes with focused debugging of worker code or creating a new queue.

**Would you like to:**
- A) Continue debugging (focus on worker code)
- B) Try a fresh/different SQS queue
- C) Stop for now and document findings
- D) Other approach?
