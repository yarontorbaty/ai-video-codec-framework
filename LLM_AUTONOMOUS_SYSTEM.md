# 🤖 LLM-Powered Autonomous AI Codec System

**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED AND RUNNING  
**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025

---

## 🎯 Overview

The AI Video Codec Framework now includes an **LLM-powered autonomous experiment planner** that analyzes results, identifies root causes of failures, and plans improved experiments. The system learns from each iteration and adapts its approach autonomously.

### **Key Innovation**
Instead of running the same experiments repeatedly, the system now:
1. **Analyzes** past experiment results from DynamoDB
2. **Reasons** about why compression is failing  
3. **Plans** next experiments with specific improvements
4. **Logs** its reasoning for transparency
5. **Iterates** autonomously every 6 hours

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Components**

#### **1. LLM Experiment Planner** (`src/agents/llm_experiment_planner.py`)
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet (or fallback rule-based logic)
- Analyzes up to 5 most recent experiments
- Generates detailed analysis with:
  - Root cause identification
  - Key insights across experiments
  - Hypothesis for improvements
  - Concrete next steps with code changes
  - Risk assessment
  - Expected bitrate and confidence score

#### **2. Autonomous Orchestrator** (`scripts/autonomous_orchestrator_llm.sh`)
- Runs every 6 hours
- Executes LLM planning phase before each experiment
- Logs all reasoning to DynamoDB
- Continues even if LLM unavailable (fallback mode)

#### **3. Reasoning Storage** (DynamoDB: `ai-video-codec-reasoning`)
- Stores LLM analysis and recommendations
- Tracks confidence scores and expected results
- Provides audit trail of autonomous decisions
- Will be displayed on dashboard for transparency

## 🔬 Current Analysis

### **Latest LLM Reasoning (Fallback Mode)**

**Root Cause:**
> "Procedural generation is rendering full video frames (18MB) instead of storing compact procedural parameters (<1KB). The system generates NEW content rather than compressing EXISTING content."

**Key Insights:**
1. All experiments show 15 Mbps output (50% LARGER than 10 Mbps HEVC baseline)
2. Neural networks are operational but not integrated into compression pipeline
3. The fundamental approach is backwards - we're creating data, not compressing it

**Hypothesis:**
> "Store procedural generation PARAMETERS (function types, coefficients, timestamps) instead of rendered frames. Each frame could be described in ~100 bytes instead of ~600KB."

**Next Experiment Plan:**
- **Approach:** Encode video as a sequence of procedural commands
- **Changes Needed:**
  1. Analyze input video to detect procedural patterns
  2. Store only generation parameters in compact format
  3. Implement decoder that regenerates frames from parameters
  4. Measure parameter storage size vs rendered video size

**Expected Results:**
- Target Bitrate: 0.8 Mbps (92% reduction vs HEVC!)
- Confidence: 75%
