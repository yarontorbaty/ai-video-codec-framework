# 🎯 ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED!

**Date:** October 18, 2025 - 10:00 AM EST  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Experiment in progress

## 🔴 The REAL Problem

### Wrong IP Address Configuration

**Orchestrator was configured with:** `10.0.2.10:8080`  
**Worker's actual IP address:** `172.31.73.149:8080`  

**Result:** Connection timeout errors because orchestrator was trying to connect to the wrong IP!

---

## 🔍 Investigation Process

### 1. Initial Symptoms
```
HTTPConnectionPool(host='10.0.2.10', port=8080): Max retries exceeded with url: /experiment 
(Caused by NewConnectionError(': Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 110] Connection timeout
```

### 2. First Diagnosis (Incorrect)
- Thought worker was not running
- Restarted worker on port 8080
- Worker was actually running fine all along!

### 3. Deeper Investigation
- Worker was running AND listening on port 8080 ✅
- Worker responded to local health checks ✅
- Security groups were configured correctly ✅
- **But orchestrator still couldn't connect** ❌

### 4. Network Analysis
Checked actual IP addresses:
```bash
# Orchestrator
Instance: i-00d8ebe7d25026fdd
Private IP: 172.31.65.249
Subnet: subnet-2f7b1b4a

# Worker  
Instance: i-01113a08e8005b235
Private IP: 172.31.73.149  ← THE REAL IP!
Subnet: subnet-2f7b1b4a
```

### 5. Root Cause Identified
```python
# config.py (BEFORE)
self.worker_url = os.getenv('WORKER_URL', 'http://10.0.2.10:8080')
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                    WRONG IP!

# config.py (AFTER)
self.worker_url = os.getenv('WORKER_URL', 'http://172.31.73.149:8080')
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                    CORRECT IP!
```

---

## ✅ The Solution

### Step 1: Update Configuration
```bash
# On orchestrator instance
cd /home/ec2-user/orchestrator
sed -i "s|10.0.2.10|172.31.73.149|g" config.py
```

### Step 2: Restart Orchestrator
```bash
pkill -f "python3 main.py"
nohup python3 main.py > orchestrator.log 2>&1 &
```

### Step 3: Verify Fix
```bash
# Orchestrator log now shows:
Worker URL: http://172.31.73.149:8080  ← CORRECT!
```

## 🎉 Current Status

### Experiment 1 - IN PROGRESS ✅

**Started:** 16:46:13  
**Status:** Worker actively processing

**Timeline:**
- ✅ **16:46:13** - Orchestrator started iteration 1
- ✅ **16:46:13** - Called Claude API
- ✅ **16:46:55** - Code generated (5896 bytes encoding, 6264 bytes decoding)
- ✅ **16:46:55** - Sent to worker at **172.31.73.149:8080** ← CORRECT IP!
- 🔄 **16:47-16:52** - Worker processing:
  - Downloaded 710MB source video from S3
  - Executing LLM-generated encoding
  - Executing LLM-generated decoding
  - Calculating PSNR/SSIM
  - Uploading results to S3

**Worker Status:**
- Process: Running ✅
- CPU: 14.3% (actively working)
- Memory: 2GB (processing large video)
- Network: Connected to orchestrator ✅

**Expected Completion:** Next 3-5 minutes (by 16:52-16:54)

## 📊 Why This Happened

### IP Address Mismatch Origins

**Likely Causes:**
1. **Infrastructure changed** - EC2 instances launched with different IPs than expected
2. **Old config** - Orchestrator config hard-coded with planned IP (10.0.2.10) instead of actual IP
3. **Deployment issue** - Config not updated when instances were actually created

### Why Security Groups Were Fine
```
Worker Security Group (sg-0885eababf6f844ba):
  - Allows TCP port 8080
  - From source: sg-0e573e2f685e36cb9 (orchestrator's SG)
  - ✅ Correct configuration

The security groups work by GROUP ID, not IP address,
so they worked fine even though orchestrator had wrong IP.
```

### Why Worker Appeared Healthy
- Worker WAS healthy and running
- Responded to localhost health checks
- Listened on port 8080
- **But orchestrator was looking in the wrong place!**

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Network Topology
```
VPC: Default VPC (us-east-1)
Subnet: subnet-2f7b1b4a (same subnet for both instances)

Orchestrator                Worker
172.31.65.249          172.31.73.149
      |                      |
      +-------- TRIED -------+
      |     10.0.2.10:8080   |  ← WRONG IP!
      |     (doesn't exist)   |
      |                      |
      +------ NOW WORKS -----+
           172.31.73.149:8080  ← CORRECT IP!
```

### Security Group Configuration
```json
{
  "WorkerSecurityGroup": "sg-0885eababf6f844ba",
  "InboundRules": [
    {
      "Protocol": "TCP",
      "Port": 8080,
      "Source": "sg-0e573e2f685e36cb9",  ← Orchestrator SG
      "Description": "Allow orchestrator to access worker"
    }
  ]
}
```

**This is correct!** Security groups reference other security groups, not IPs, so they worked fine.

5. **Log worker activity** to make debugging easier

### Improvements to Make
1. **Use DNS names** instead of IP addresses
2. **Add service discovery** (AWS Service Discovery / Route53 private DNS)
3. **Add connectivity tests** to deployment scripts
4. **Add worker logging** to track request processing
5. **Add health endpoint monitoring** from orchestrator
