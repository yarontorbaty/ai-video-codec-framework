# ✅ Procedural Experiment System - Deployed!

## 🎉 Deployment Complete - October 17, 2025

The autonomous AI video codec system has been upgraded from **time-based** to **procedural** experiment execution!

---

## 📦 What Was Deployed:

### 1. **Orchestrator** (i-063947ae46af6dbf8)
- ✅ `scripts/autonomous_orchestrator_llm.sh` - New procedural orchestrator
- ✅ `src/agents/procedural_experiment_runner.py` - 7-step procedural runner
- ✅ **Orchestrator running** (PID: 8997)

### 2. **Dashboard** (CloudFront + S3)
- ✅ `dashboard/admin.js` - Human intervention tracking UI
- ✅ `lambda/admin_api.py` - Human intervention data API
- ✅ **CloudFront invalidated** - Changes live

---

## 🔄 New Experiment Flow:

### Instead of:
```
Run experiment → Wait 60s → Run experiment → Wait 60s...
(with 10min timeout and no retry)
```

### Now:
```
1. Design experiment and code
2. Deploy to sandbox
3. Validate (retry up to 5x with auto-fixes)
4. Execute (retry up to 5x with auto-fixes)
5. Analyze results
6. Design next experiment
7. Flag for human if max retries exceeded
```

**No artificial time limits!** Experiments run until completion or max retries.

---

## 🛠️ Key Features Now Live:

### 1. **Intelligent Retry**
- Validation fails → Analyze → Auto-fix → Retry (up to 5x)
- Execution fails → Analyze → Auto-fix → Retry (up to 5x)
- Uses `FrameworkModifier` tools to fix issues

### 2. **Human Intervention Tracking**
- Pulsing red "HUMAN NEEDED" badge in dashboard
- Modal shows phase, reason, and failure details
- `needs_human` field in DynamoDB
- `human_intervention_reasons` array

### 3. **Self-Healing**
- Can modify sandbox restrictions
- Can install missing packages
- Can update framework code
- Restarts orchestrator after fixes

### 4. **Minimal Delays**
- 10s between successful experiments
- 30s between failed attempts
- 5min after 5 consecutive failures (recovery mode)

---

## 📊 Monitoring:

### Dashboard (https://aiv1codec.com/admin):
- **New Column**: "<i class="fas fa-user-cog"></i> Human" 
- **Pulsing Red Badge**: When intervention needed
- **Click badge**: View detailed failure reasons
- **Modal**: Shows phase, reason, and fix attempts

### Orchestrator Logs (/tmp/orch.log):
```bash
# SSH to orchestrator
./scripts/ssh_to_instances.sh --orchestrator

# Watch logs
tail -f /tmp/orch.log

# Look for phase indicators:
📐 PHASE 1: DESIGN
📦 PHASE 2: DEPLOY
🔍 PHASE 3: VALIDATION (with intelligent retry)
▶️  PHASE 4: EXECUTION (with intelligent retry)
📊 PHASE 5: ANALYSIS
✅ EXPERIMENT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

# Or human intervention:
🚨 HUMAN INTERVENTION REQUIRED:
  - validation: Max validation retries exceeded
```

---

## 🎯 What to Expect:

### Immediate (Next 30 min):
- Orchestrator wakes up for next experiment
- New procedural logs appear
- Phase-by-phase execution visible
- First experiment with new system completes

### Short-term (Next 24 hours):
- Experiments take longer (thorough validation)
- But higher success rate
- Self-healing events logged
- Tool usage for framework fixes

### Medium-term (Next week):
- Fewer human interventions over time
- Framework becomes more robust
- LLM learns what works
- Code evolution accelerates

---

## 🧪 Testing:

To verify the system is working:

```bash
# 1. Check orchestrator status
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=ai-video-codec-orchestrator" "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].InstanceId' --output text

# 2. Check logs
ssh ec2-user@<orchestrator-ip>
tail -f /tmp/orch.log | grep "PHASE"

# 3. Monitor dashboard
open https://aiv1codec.com/admin

# 4. Look for procedural log pattern:
# "PHASE 1: DESIGN" → "PHASE 2: DEPLOY" → etc.
```

---

## 📈 Performance Comparison:

### Old System:
- Average time per experiment: 60s (fixed)
- Success rate: ~60% (guessing)
- Retry on failure: ❌ No
- Self-healing: ❌ No
- Human notification: ❌ No
- Wasted time: High (60s delays)

### New System:
- Average time per experiment: Variable (until complete)
- Expected success rate: ~90% (with retries)
- Retry on failure: ✅ Yes (up to 5x per phase)
- Self-healing: ✅ Yes (framework tools)
- Human notification: ✅ Yes (dashboard alerts)
- Wasted time: Minimal (10s between success)

**Net result**: Slower per experiment, but much higher throughput of successful experiments!

---

## 🔧 Rollback (if needed):

If the new system has issues, rollback with:

```bash
# SSH to orchestrator
ssh ec2-user@<orchestrator-ip>

# Stop current orchestrator
pkill -f autonomous_orchestrator_llm.sh

# Restore old version from git
cd /home/ec2-user/ai-video-codec
git checkout HEAD~1 scripts/autonomous_orchestrator_llm.sh

# Restart
nohup bash scripts/autonomous_orchestrator_llm.sh > /tmp/orch.log 2>&1 &
```

---

## 🎓 Why This Matters:

**Before**: System was constrained by arbitrary time windows, leading to incomplete experiments and wasted cycles.

**After**: System works through problems methodically until resolution, maximizing learning and progress.

This is a **fundamental shift** from:
- Time-based → Completion-based
- Fire-and-forget → Retry-until-success
- Silent failures → Loud human notifications
- Fixed delays → Adaptive timing

**The system is now truly autonomous AND thorough!**

---

## 📝 Next Actions:

1. ✅ **Monitor first procedural experiment** (check logs in ~30 min)
2. ✅ **Verify dashboard shows new "Human" column**
3. ✅ **Watch for self-healing events** (tool usage in logs)
4. ✅ **Check for human intervention alerts** (if any retries fail)
5. ✅ **Observe improved success rate** over next 24 hours
