- **URL:** https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards:name=NeuralCodec-HTTP-Monitoring
- **Metrics:** CPU, Network, Experiment counts, Response times

### **2. CloudWatch Alarms (with SNS notifications)**
- `neural-codec-worker-cpu-high` - Worker CPU > 80%
- `neural-codec-orchestrator-cpu-high` - Orchestrator CPU > 80%
- `neural-codec-worker-status-check` - Worker health check failures
- `neural-codec-orchestrator-status-check` - Orchestrator health check failures

### **3. SNS Alerting**
- **Topic:** `neural-codec-alerts`
- **ARN:** `arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:580473065386:neural-codec-alerts`
- **Notifications:** Email alerts for critical issues

### **4. Custom Metrics (NeuralCodec/HTTP namespace)**
- `WorkerHealth` - Worker service health (0/1)
- `WorkerResponseTime` - Worker API response time (ms)
- `JobsProcessed` - Total jobs processed by worker
- `OrchestratorHealth` - Orchestrator service health (0/1)
- `OrchestratorResponseTime` - Orchestrator API response time (ms)
- `ActiveExperiments` - Currently running experiments
- `AvailableWorkers` - Number of healthy workers

### **5. CloudWatch Log Groups**
- `/aws/neural-codec/http-worker` - Worker logs (30-day retention)
- `/aws/neural-codec/http-orchestrator` - Orchestrator logs (30-day retention)

---

## ðŸš¨ **Alert Thresholds**

### **Critical Alerts (Immediate notification):**
- **CPU Utilization:** > 80% for 10 minutes
- **Health Check Failures:** Any failure
- **Service Unreachable:** HTTP connection failures
- **No Available Workers:** All workers unhealthy

### **Recovery Notifications:**
- Alarms clearing (services back to normal)
- Health checks passing again
- Workers becoming available

---

## ðŸ“± **Monitoring Tools**

### **1. Automated Monitoring Script**
```bash
# Single health check
python3 scripts/monitor_system.py --once

# Continuous monitoring (5 minutes)
python3 scripts/monitor_system.py --duration 5

# Continuous monitoring (until stopped)
python3 scripts/monitor_system.py
```

### **2. Manual Health Checks**
```bash
# Worker health
curl http://18.208.180.67:8080/health

# Orchestrator health
curl http://34.239.1.29:8081/health

# Worker status
curl http://18.208.180.67:8080/status

# Active experiments
curl http://34.239.1.29:8081/experiments
```

### **3. Health Check Scripts**
```bash
# Worker health check
./scripts/worker_health_check.sh

# Orchestrator health check
./scripts/orchestrator_health_check.sh
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Real-Time Monitoring Results**

### **Current System Status:**
```json
{
  "worker": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "response_time_ms": 509.3,
    "jobs_processed": 1,
    "device": "cpu"
  },
  "orchestrator": {
    "status": "healthy", 
    "response_time_ms": 203.5,
    "available_workers": 1,
    "active_experiments": 1
  },
  "overall": "âœ… All systems healthy"
}
```

### **Key Metrics Being Tracked:**
- **Response Times:** Worker: 509ms, Orchestrator: 203ms
- **Availability:** 100% (both services healthy)
- **Throughput:** 1 experiment processed successfully
- **Resource Usage:** Normal (CPU < 80%)
