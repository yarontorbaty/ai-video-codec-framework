## 🟡 Requires Attention (But Still Compatible)

### 1. FFmpeg
**License:** LGPL 2.1+ (can be GPL 2+ depending on compilation)
- **Issue:** LGPL requires dynamic linking; GPL requires source disclosure
- **Solution:** 
  - Use LGPL version (default)
  - Dynamically link (standard practice)
  - Document FFmpeg as external dependency
- **Verdict:** ✅ OK for open source (just document properly)

### 2. VMAF (Video Quality Metric)
**License:** BSD-2-Clause + Patent Grant
- **Issue:** Has patent provisions from Netflix
- **Solution:**
  - Netflix provides free patent license
  - BSD-2-Clause is permissive
  - Read patent grant carefully
- **Verdict:** ✅ OK for open source (patent grant included)

### 3. AWS SDK (boto3)
**License:** Apache 2.0
- **Issue:** AWS services are proprietary (but SDK is open source)
- **Solution:**
  - SDK itself is open source
  - Make AWS optional/pluggable
  - Support local execution
  - Document cloud-agnostic design
- **Verdict:** ✅ OK (SDK is Apache 2.0, just make backends pluggable)

---

## 🟠 Optional/Proprietary (Can Be Made Optional)

### 1. TensorRT
**License:** Proprietary (NVIDIA)
- **Issue:** Closed source, NVIDIA-only
- **Solution:**
  - Make it an **optional optimization**
  - Provide ONNX Runtime as default
  - Document as "optional acceleration"
  - Code should work without it
- **Verdict:** ✅ OK if optional (not required for core functionality)

### 2. Weights & Biases (wandb)
**License:** MIT (client) + Proprietary (service)
- **Issue:** Service requires account
- **Solution:**
  - Make logging backend pluggable
  - Support TensorBoard as default
  - W&B is optional enhancement
- **Verdict:** ✅ OK if optional

### 3. CoreML Tools
**License:** BSD-3-Clause (tools) + Apple ecosystem
- **Issue:** Apple-specific
- **Solution:**
  - Keep as optional for iOS/macOS
  - Not required for core functionality
- **Verdict:** ✅ OK as optional platform-specific optimization

## 🔴 Pre-trained Models (BIGGEST CONCERN)

### Potential Issues

If you use pre-trained models from research papers:

| Model | Typical License | Commercial Use? | Open Source? |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| CLIP (OpenAI) | MIT | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| RAFT (Optical Flow) | BSD-3-Clause | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| DeepLabV3 | Apache 2.0 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Stable Diffusion | CreativeML OpenRAIL-M | ⚠️ With restrictions | ⚠️ With restrictions |

**Solutions:**

1. **Train your own models** (clean-room implementation)
2. **Use only permissively-licensed pretrained models**
3. **Make pretrained models optional** (framework works without them)
4. **Document model licenses clearly**

**Recommendation:** 
- Use PyTorch/TensorFlow model architectures (open source)
- Train from scratch or use ImageNet/COCO pretrained weights (permissive)
- Avoid OpenAI DALL-E or other restrictive models
- CLIP and DeepLabV3 are safe (permissive licenses)

## 📋 Recommended Open Source Strategy

### Option A: Permissive License (Recommended)
**Use: MIT or Apache 2.0**

✅ **Advantages:**
- Maximum adoption
- Commercial use allowed
- Can be integrated into proprietary systems
- Industry standard for ML projects
- Compatible with all dependencies

❌ **Disadvantages:**
- Others can create proprietary forks
- No copyleft protection

**Best for:** Broad adoption, industry use, research

### Option B: Copyleft License
**Use: GPL v3 or AGPL v3**

✅ **Advantages:**
- Ensures derivatives stay open source
- Stronger community control
- Prevents proprietary capture

❌ **Disadvantages:**
- Limits commercial adoption
- More restrictive for integrators
- May conflict with some dependencies

**Best for:** Community-driven, research-focused projects

### Option C: Weak Copyleft
**Use: LGPL or MPL 2.0**

✅ **Advantages:**
- Balance between permissive and copyleft
- Can be used in commercial products
- Changes must be shared

❌ **Disadvantages:**
- More complex to understand
- Less common in ML space

---

## 🎯 Recommended License: **Apache 2.0**

**Why Apache 2.0?**

1. ✅ **Industry Standard** - Used by PyTorch, TensorFlow, most ML projects
2. ✅ **Patent Protection** - Includes explicit patent grant
3. ✅ **Permissive** - Allows commercial use, modification, distribution
4. ✅ **Compatible** - Works with all our dependencies
5. ✅ **Clear Attribution** - Requires license and copyright notices
6. ✅ **No Copyleft** - Doesn't require derivatives to be open source

**Used by:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Kubernetes, Android, Apache projects

## 🌍 Cloud Provider Agnostic Design

To make this truly open source, abstract cloud providers:

```python
# ❌ Bad: AWS-specific
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
s3_client.upload_file(...)

# ✅ Good: Provider-agnostic
class StorageBackend(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def upload(self, local_path, remote_path): pass
    
class S3Storage(StorageBackend):
    def upload(self, local_path, remote_path):
        # AWS implementation
        
class GCSStorage(StorageBackend):
    def upload(self, local_path, remote_path):
        # Google Cloud implementation
        
class LocalStorage(StorageBackend):
    def upload(self, local_path, remote_path):
        # Local filesystem implementation
```

---

## 🎓 Pre-trained Model Strategy

### Clean-Room Approach (Safest)

1. **Train from scratch** on public datasets
2. **Use ImageNet pretrained weights** (permissive)
3. **Document all model sources**
4. **Provide training scripts** so users can train their own

### Alternative: Model Zoo with Licenses

```
models/
├── LICENSE.md                    # Model licenses
├── imagenet_pretrained/          # Apache 2.0 or similar
│   └── resnet50.pth
├── coco_pretrained/              # Apache 2.0
│   └── deeplabv3.pth
└── custom_trained/               # Your license
    └── codec_model.pth
```
