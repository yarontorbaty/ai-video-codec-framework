# 🤖 Autonomous Git Commits - LLM Self-Improvement Branch

## 🎉 System Now Commits Its Own Improvements!

The LLM can now modify the framework AND automatically commit/push changes to a dedicated branch without human intervention!

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented:

### 1. **Git Branch: `self-improved-framework`**
- Created and pushed to GitHub
- Dedicated branch for LLM's autonomous modifications
- Keeps `main` branch stable
- Human can review via Pull Requests

### 2. **Automatic Git Integration**
When LLM uses `modify_framework_file` tool:
1. ✅ **File modified** on orchestrator
2. ✅ **Automatically staged** (`git add`)
3. ✅ **Automatically committed** with detailed message
4. ✅ **Automatically pushed** to `origin/self-improved-framework`
5. ✅ **Tracked in history** for rollback if needed

### 3. **Smart Commit Messages**
Every LLM modification gets a commit like:
```
🤖 LLM: Add bytearray to sandbox builtins for binary data manipulation

File: src/utils/code_sandbox.py
Timestamp: 2025-10-17T12:34:56.789Z
Agent: AI Video Codec Autonomous Framework Modifier
```

Includes:
- **Reason**: Why the LLM made the change
- **File**: What was modified
- **Timestamp**: When it happened
- **Agent**: Who made the change

## 🔄 Full Workflow:

### Scenario: LLM Encounters Missing Builtin

**Step 1: LLM Detects Issue**
```
Validation failed: NameError: name 'scipy' is not defined
```

**Step 2: LLM Uses Tool**
```json
{
  "tool": "modify_framework_file",
  "file_path": "requirements.txt",
  "modification_type": "append",
  "content": "scipy==1.11.0",
  "reason": "Add scipy package for scientific computing in codec algorithms"
}
```

**Step 3: FrameworkModifier Executes**
- Modifies `requirements.txt`
- Creates backup
- Runs `git add requirements.txt`
- Runs `git commit -m "🤖 LLM: Add scipy package..."`
- Runs `git push origin self-improved-framework`

**Step 4: Visible on GitHub**
- New commit appears on `self-improved-framework` branch
- Human can see change in GitHub UI
- Can review, approve, or merge to `main`

**Step 5: LLM Continues**
- Next validation attempt succeeds
- Experiment proceeds
- System self-healed!

## 📊 Deployment Status:

✅ **Branch Created**: `self-improved-framework` pushed to origin  
✅ **Orchestrator Updated**: PID 9234, running on `self-improved-framework` branch  
✅ **Git Configured**: Agent identity set  
✅ **Experiments Purged**: Clean slate (24 items deleted)  
✅ **Auto-commit Active**: Ready for LLM modifications

## 🔍 Monitoring LLM Git Activity:

### View Commits on GitHub:
```
https://github.com/yarontorbaty/ai-video-codec-framework/commits/self-improved-framework
```

### Check Orchestrator Logs:
```bash
./scripts/ssh_to_instances.sh --orchestrator
tail -f /tmp/orch.log

# Look for:
✅ Modified src/utils/code_sandbox.py: Add missing builtin
✅ Committed: src/utils/code_sandbox.py
✅ Pushed to origin/self-improved-framework
```

### View Git History on Orchestrator:
```bash
ssh ec2-user@<orchestrator-ip>
cd /home/ec2-user/ai-video-codec
git log --oneline --graph self-improved-framework
```

---

## 🛡️ Safety Mechanisms:

### 1. **Separate Branch**
- LLM commits go to `self-improved-framework`
- `main` branch stays stable
- Human controls merging

### 2. **Automatic Backups**
- Every file modification creates timestamped backup
- Stored in `.framework_backups/`
- Can rollback if needed

### 3. **Modification History**
- All changes tracked in `modification_history`
- Includes: file, type, reason, timestamp, git status

### 4. **File Allowlist**
- Only specific patterns can be modified:
  - `src/**/*.py`
  - `scripts/**/*.py`
  - `scripts/**/*.sh`
  - `requirements.txt`
  - `LLM_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`

### 5. **Git Push Timeout**
- 30-second timeout on push operations
- Prevents hanging on network issues

---

## 📈 Expected Behavior:

### Immediate (Next 30 min):
- LLM starts first experiment with new procedural system
- May encounter issues requiring framework fixes
- If so, will use tools and auto-commit changes

### Short-term (Next 24 hours):
- Multiple commits to `self-improved-framework` branch
- Self-healing events logged
- Framework becomes more robust
- Experiments succeed more consistently

### Medium-term (Next week):
- Dozens of LLM commits
- Clear evolution visible in git history
- Can review changes and merge good ones to `main`
- Bad changes can be reverted

---

## 🎯 Human Review Process:

### Option 1: Review Commits Individually
```bash
# View specific commit
git show <commit-hash>

# Cherry-pick good commits to main
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Create Pull Request
```bash
# On GitHub:
1. Go to "Pull Requests"
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Base: main, Compare: self-improved-framework
4. Review changes
5. Merge if satisfied
```

### Option 3: Merge Entire Branch
```bash
git checkout main
git merge self-improved-framework
git push origin main
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration:

### Disable Git Commits (if needed):
Edit `/home/ec2-user/ai-video-codec/src/utils/framework_modifier.py`:
```python
self.git_enabled = False  # Change from True
```

### Change Target Branch:
```python
self.git_branch = "your-branch-name"  # Change from "self-improved-framework"
```

### Change Git Identity:
```python
self.git_user_name = "Your Name"
self.git_user_email = "your@email.com"
```

## 💡 Why This Matters:

**Before**: 
- LLM could modify framework
- But changes were local only
- No version control
- No audit trail
- Hard to review
- Hard to rollback

**After**:
- ✅ Full version control
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ Easy review on GitHub
- ✅ Easy rollback
- ✅ Separate branch for safety
- ✅ Clear commit messages
- ✅ **No human intervention needed**

**Result**: The LLM can now evolve the framework autonomously while maintaining full traceability and safety!

## 🎓 Example Timeline:

**Hour 1**: LLM encounters missing builtin → Adds it → Commits → Pushes  
**Hour 2**: LLM needs new package → Adds to requirements.txt → Commits → Pushes  
**Hour 3**: LLM finds inefficiency → Optimizes code → Commits → Pushes  
**Hour 4**: LLM improves error handling → Updates code → Commits → Pushes  
**Day 2**: Human reviews 15 commits → Merges 12 to main → Reverts 3 bad ones  
**Day 7**: 50+ commits, framework significantly improved by LLM!

---

## 📝 Next Actions:

1. ✅ **Monitor first LLM commit** (~30-60 min when issue arises)
2. ✅ **Check GitHub branch** for new commits
3. ✅ **Review commit messages** to understand LLM's reasoning
4. ✅ **Test merged changes** before deploying to main
5. ✅ **Document emergent behaviors** for research
