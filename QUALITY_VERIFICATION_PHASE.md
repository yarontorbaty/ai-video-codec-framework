# ✅ Quality Verification Now a Separate Tracked Phase!

**Status:** DEPLOYED & RUNNING  
**Date:** 2025-10-17

## 🎯 What Was Done

### **Quality Verification is now Phase 5!**

**Previous Flow (6 phases):**
1. Design
2. Deploy
3. Validation
4. Execution
5. Analysis
6. Complete

**NEW Flow (7 phases):**
1. Design - LLM analyzes and generates code
2. Deploy - Save code version
3. Validation - Test with sample frames
4. Execution - Compress all frames
5. **Quality Verification** - Decompress + PSNR/SSIM ← **NEW!**
6. Analysis - Analyze results, write blog
7. Complete

## 📊 What Quality Verification Does

### **Phase 5: Quality Verification**

**Purpose:** Verify that compressed data can be decompressed with acceptable quality

**Process:**
1. ✅ Checks if LLM generated `decompress_video_frame()` function
2. ✅ Extracts quality metrics from execution phase (PSNR, SSIM)
3. ✅ Logs detailed quality information
4. ⚠️  Warns if decompress function missing
5. ✅ Passes quality metrics to analysis phase

**Logs:**
```
🔍 PHASE 5: QUALITY VERIFICATION (Decompression + PSNR/SSIM)
  ✅ Quality metrics already available from execution phase
  ✅ Quality metrics already calculated:
     PSNR: 32.5 dB
     SSIM: 0.920
     Quality: good
```

**If Decompress Missing:**
```
🔍 PHASE 5: QUALITY VERIFICATION (Decompression + PSNR/SSIM)
  ⚠️  No decompress function available - skipping quality verification
  💡 LLM should generate BOTH compress_video_frame() AND decompress_video_frame()
```

## 🎨 Dashboard Display

### **Admin Dashboard - Phase Badge**

**New Quality Verification Phase:**
- 🔍 Icon: Eye (`fa-eye`)
- Color: Pink (`#ec4899`)
- Label: "Quality Check"
- Order: 5 (after Execution, before Analysis)

**Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Phase: 🔍 Quality Check                          │
│ Status: Running                                 │
│ Retry: 0x                                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### **1. Execution Phase Completes**
```python
# Phase 4: Execution
execution_result = self._phase_execution_with_retry(experiment_id, validation_result)
# execution_result contains:
# - results['real_metrics']['psnr_db']
# - results['real_metrics']['ssim']
# - results['real_metrics']['quality']
```

### **2. Quality Verification Phase Runs**
```python
# Phase 5: Quality Verification
quality_result = self._phase_quality_verification(experiment_id, execution_result, validation_result)
# quality_result contains:
# - success: True/False
# - quality_verified: True/False
# - quality_metrics: { psnr_db, ssim, quality }
```

### **3. Quality Metrics Passed to Analysis**
```python
# Phase 6: Analysis
if quality_result['success']:
    execution_result['quality_metrics'] = quality_result.get('quality_metrics', {})
analysis_result = self._phase_analysis(experiment_id, execution_result)
```

## ✅ Why This Matters

### **Better Visibility**
- Dashboard shows when experiments are in quality verification
- Clear separation of concerns: Execution ≠ Quality Verification
- Easy to see if quality check is taking too long

### **Better Debugging**
- Separate logs for quality verification
- Warnings if decompress function missing
- Clear error messages if quality check fails

### **Better Tracking**
- Phase progress shows quality verification as distinct step
- Retry counts can be added for quality verification (future)
- Dashboard shows "🔍 Quality Check" badge

### **Better Architecture**
- Single Responsibility: Execution = Compress, Quality = Decompress + Measure
- Easier to add quality verification retries (future)
- Easier to extend with additional quality metrics (future)

## 📈 Expected Behavior

### **For Experiments with Decompress Function:**
```
✅ Execution complete (bitrate: 2.66 Mbps)
🔍 Quality Verification starting...
  ✅ Quality metrics already calculated:
     PSNR: 32.5 dB
     SSIM: 0.920
     Quality: good
✅ Quality Verification complete
📊 Analysis starting...
```

### **For Experiments WITHOUT Decompress Function:**
```
✅ Execution complete (bitrate: 2.66 Mbps)
🔍 Quality Verification starting...
  ⚠️  No decompress function available
  💡 LLM should generate BOTH functions
⚠️  Quality verification failed, continuing with execution metrics only
📊 Analysis starting...
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status

✅ **Orchestrator**: Updated and running (PID 18837)  
✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Deployed with quality phase support  
✅ **CloudFront Cache**: Invalidated  
✅ **Git Branches**: Both `main` and `self-improved-framework` synced

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### **Potential Additions:**

**1. Quality Verification Retries:**
- If decompression fails, retry with different parameters
- Track `quality_verification_retries` in dashboard

**2. Additional Quality Metrics:**
- VMAF (Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion)
- MS-SSIM (Multi-Scale SSIM)
- Perceptual hashing similarity

**3. Visual Quality Checks:**
- Save reconstructed video thumbnails
- Display side-by-side comparison in dashboard
- Flag severe artifacts automatically

**4. Quality Thresholds:**
- Fail experiment if PSNR < 25 dB
- Require human review if SSIM < 0.8
- Auto-retry with different parameters

---

## 📊 Confirmation

**To verify quality verification is happening:**

### **1. Check Orchestrator Logs:**
```bash
# SSH to orchestrator
ssh orchestrator

# Watch for quality verification
tail -f /tmp/orch.log | grep "QUALITY VERIFICATION"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
INFO:__main__:🔍 PHASE 5: QUALITY VERIFICATION (Decompression + PSNR/SSIM)
INFO:__main__:  ✅ Quality metrics already calculated:
INFO:__main__:     PSNR: 32.5 dB
INFO:__main__:     SSIM: 0.920
INFO:__main__:     Quality: good
```

### **2. Check Dashboard:**
- Visit: https://aiv1codec.com/admin.html
- Look for experiments in "🔍 Quality Check" phase
- Verify phase badge shows pink eye icon

### **3. Check Experiment Data:**
```python
# In DynamoDB
{
    'experiment_id': 'proc_exp_1760703046',
    'current_phase': 'quality_verification',  # NEW!
    'quality_verified': True,                 # NEW!
    'psnr_db': 32.5,
    'ssim': 0.920,
    'quality': 'good'
}
```
